# RayTracer

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/trcg4q9tc6u6583w)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stevenandrewcarter/raytracer)

A Simple RayTracer built in C++. It will cast rays from the camera and determine if the rays ever hit the light source. 
While the rays bounce it will gather the colours of the surfaces it reflects off on the way.
